# Basic Calculator

A simple command-line calculator that supports:

- Addition  
- Subtraction  
- Multiplication  
- Division  
- Modulus  

## Features

- User-friendly command-line interface  
- Handles division by zero gracefully  
- Supports continuous calculations with retry option  

## How to Use

Run the calculator script:

```bash
python basic_calculator/calculator.py
````

Follow the on-screen prompts to select an operation and enter numbers.

## Testing

This project uses Python’s built-in `unittest` framework to verify the correctness of calculator functions.

The key method used in tests is `self.assertEqual(a, b)`. It checks whether the value of `a` is equal to `b`. If they are equal, the test passes; otherwise, it fails.

For example, the test:

```python
self.assertEqual(add(3, 4), 7)
```

checks that calling `add(3, 4)` returns `7`.

The test suite covers different cases for each operation, including positive, negative, and zero values, as well as special cases like division by zero.

### Running Tests

To run all tests, use this command from the project root:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

You should see output confirming tests passed:

```
